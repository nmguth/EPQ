# Extended Project Qualification
**EPQ project by Nathan Guth**
This repository is an archive of my project I did alongside my A-Levels during the academic year 2018-19.
Here is a list of all the files in this repo, and their purpose:


- FINAL
	 - The entirety of my project as it was sent to the exam board
 - Audio works
	 -  The working list of musical samples I had made
 - Presentation
	 - The working directory for the multiple versions of my powerpoint.
 - Resources
 	 - A compilation of the various written and audio sources I used throughout my project.
 - Write Up
	 - The various drafts of my write-up as I was writing them.
